🧠 Bright – Learning Reimagined for Neurodiverse Students

Bright is a prototype web app that transforms school material into short, interactive micro-lessons designed to support learners with ADHD and short attention spans. It uses multimodal presentation (video, text, quiz), gamified feedback, and a distraction-minimizing UI to enhance engagement and retention.

🎬 AI-generated animated video lessons

📖 Sentence-by-sentence read-aloud story mode

🧠 Interactive quiz with instant XP feedback

🤖 Built-in AI tutor for on-demand clarification and games

🌈 Clean, focus-optimized interface

🏆 Gamified XP system for motivation

🇬🇷 Based on Greek Ministry of Education content (translated)
